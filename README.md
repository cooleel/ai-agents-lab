# AI Agent Lab

This is a personal learning and experimentation repo for building AI agents.

The goal of this repository is to:
- Practice implementing AI agent patterns
- Explore tools, memory, planning, and orchestration
- Collect runnable examples from courses, tutorials, and experiments
- Serve as a long-term playground for hands-on agent development
